1) Order Details on BackEnd
    - Add customer/shipping info, change from product ID to product name, add product price
    - Done with join statements
2) Another Javascript Library
    - A graphic would be ideal
    - To visualize product sales - X axis products, and Y axis amount purchased
3) Back End Product Page
    - Add item/brand/category to be edited with product details (associative tables)
    - Drop downs would be easiest
4) Add CRUD for Item/Brand/Category
