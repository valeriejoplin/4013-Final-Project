To Do:

Clean Up Files
    + Group Styling
    + Use php reference files
    + File Image Stucture, place all under assets
        - Need to changes references in all locations
    + Maybe a front end back end folder to seperate files further
        - Need to change refernces in all locations

Front End/
    -Header
        +Make sure same throughout
    -Footer
        +Make sure same throughout
    -Cart
        ++ Rename to 'frontEndCart.php' requires changing references in files
        + Format
        + Logs Products Purchased
        + On check out removes quanity purchased from DB (Last thing to do! Not nessecary at this time. If doesnt remove invenotry we can place orders on site to populate sales history)
        + Cart only allows for number in stock to be added to cart.
        + Click on item to go back to details page
        + Use Query to show details about product
        + Be able to calculate total (Add this to orders database)
        + Not using session array in best way. Need to better learn this to use a key value pair system. Currently even elements in array are productID and the odd element following is the quantity added
        + Would be cool to use javascript address auto complete function
        + Add a clear cart button to destroy session and clear cart
    - Catalog
        + Make 3 none filters redirect to catalog not fiter page with same query as catalog
        + If filtered values are not set reditect to catalog page, curretly gives a php warning
        + Format header (Most Pages Need)
        + Show only instock products change query to be where quantity is greater than 0 wont impact now but will later when we start to keep track of quanties
        + Could add a filter based on price
    - Contact Page
        + Format
        + Make email footer button take to contact page
        + Can make the automated email response an html file instead of the text string we have
    - Home
        + Pop up only show first time in session
        + Show Featured Products maybe recently sold products tops 2 maybe 3? could do a w3.js slide show like about page
        + Format Footer
        + Can make the automated email response an html file instead of the text string we have
    - About
        + Make sure everyones information is up to date
        + Format Footer
    - Product
        + Buy now records in orderProduct table as well as orders **Start with this before doing cart, as we first have to solve not adding to cart more than is in stock**
        + Comment Section and Database (One Table added to DB)
        + On check out removes quanity purchased from DB
            - Could have customer do input of 1-5 then display that as starts using javascrip
        + Would be cool to use javascript address auto complete function


Back End
    -Put pages into a div of class="container"
        + Will fortmat to have padding on each side of screen (like front end)
    - Seperate page to add/edit Brand/Catagory/Item **Needs to be done before the Add/Edit products**
        + Add delete feature with pop up alert asking to confirm passthrough information about item to be deleted into popup
    - Add/Edit Products
        + Filter products in stock
        + Add delete feature with pop up alert asking to confirm passthrough information about item to be deleted into popup
        + Drop down for Selecting Brand/Catagory/Item
    - Add javascript graphic for purchase history **Can only be done after the product quantities are recorded** Can be done after Andrew sets up the buy now product quantity recording.
        + Text based table too?
        + One group had table able to be exported to excel/csv
    - Add Database Diagram
        + Could make this with an adobe reader javascrip pdf viewer plug in. Ask andrew he has used before on personal site
    -Sections to view all comments at once
        + We want a delete/remove comment feature here
    - Write up about website
