1) Order Details on BackEnd
    - Add customer/shipping info, change from product ID to product name, add product price
    - Done with join statements
2) Another Javascript Library
    - A graphic would be ideal
    - To visualize product sales (X axis products, and Y axis amount purchased)
3) Back End Product Page
    - Add item/brand/category to be edited with product details (associative tables)
    - Drop downs would be easiest
4) Add CRUD for Item/Brand/Category

Extra things to do: Found no matter how much we do find something else we could do.

1) Back End Place in containers to give padding on sides of webpage
2) Front end home page featured products
3) Buy now resubmits on page reload (creates duplicate order)
4) More detailed information show after check out (ie add a reciept)
5) Tie back end login to session so that cant use direct link to backend to skip login
6) Inventory management system (currently purchases do not remove inventory)
    - Also need to record price history for purchases
7) Center Contact Information on Contact Page
8) Coupon field on checkout page actually applies a discount
9) Padding of signup field on front end home page
